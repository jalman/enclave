what type of information do we want to share?
want to coordinate soldiers to attack and defend encampments
global strategy: play offense and win, or play defense and nuke
other tactics: messing up our opponents' messaging, making sure our communications are secure

security:
have some fields which HQ updates every round
encrypt with some secret key? flux?
sign each message to prevent tampering
check several canonical locations for messages, use the untampered one

HQ should be in charge of most messages
on the other hand, 10000 for HQ might not be enough...
